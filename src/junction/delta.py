"""The Junction Delta API

The Delta API uses sets of Modification's to build lists of API calls to execute against Confluence in order
to reconcile it with the pages in the local filesystem.

It assumes the wiki space is managed by Junction in its entirety and no other modifications are performed
manually.  The Delta API works well for large wiki spaces because it minimizes the amount of data that needs
to be fetched from Confluence, as well as the number of API calls needed to update the wiki.

The downside of the Delta API is certain errors will leave the wiki either in an unreconcilable state or it
will "leak" some pages, usually index pages, that need to be cleaned up by hand.

The Delta API breaks up modifications into several different actions and executes them in this order:
    * Page Deletes (and cleaning up any indexes without children after those deletes)
    * Starting Page Moves, by moving them to the root of the space with a randomly generated name (and cleaning up any indexes without children after those moves)
    * Page Creates (and making any index pages that do not already exist)
    * Finishing Page Moves, by moving them to their final destinations with the desired name (and making any index pages that do not already exist)
    * Page Updates

This ordering was chosen very specifically, along with the choice to split page moves in this seemingly peculiar way, to deal with various potential edge cases
that can occur based on the type of modifications, some examples:
    * A Page "A.md" gets moved into a folder with the same name and gets a new name "A/Foobar.md"
    * A Folder "Foobar" gets deleted and replaced with a file by the same name "Foobar.md"
These edge cases even occur in Confluence naturally, with users having to rename pages/move them around as they shuffle the page hierarchy.  This was the most sane, generic
way to replicate that procedure.

        thus making it work well for large wiki spaces.
